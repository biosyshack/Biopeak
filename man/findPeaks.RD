\title{Identification of peaks in an expression signal}
\usage{
findPeaks(expr)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{A numeric vector with gene expression values}
}
\value{
Returns a list comprising of a numeric vector with the location of each peak (peakloc), a numeric vector
with the absolute height of each peak (peakheight) and a character vector of gene symbols for which at least one
peak has been identified (peakgenes).
}
\description{
This helper function identifies peaks in an expression signal by treating the gene expression as a signal that
propagates along an experimental axis. A peak is defined as a local maximum in the expression signal satisfying:
y(t) > y(t+1) and y(t) > y(t-1), where y(t) represents the gene expression as a function of series condition t.
}
\examples{
# Example based on the heat-shock dataset
data(heat)
heat = as.matrix(heat)
# Run the findPeaks function for the first gene in the expression matrix
peaks <- findPeaks(heat[1,])
