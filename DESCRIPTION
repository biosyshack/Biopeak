Title: Identification of Impulse-Like Gene Expression Changes in Short Genomic Series Data
Version: 1.0
Author: David Lauenstein
Maintainer: David Lauenstein <david.lauenstein@gmail.com>
Description: Enables the user to systematically identify and visualize impulse-like gene expression changes within short genomic series experiments. In order to detect such activation peaks, the gene expression is treated as a signal that propagates along an experimental axis (time, temperature or other series conditions). Peaks are selected by exhaustive identification of local maximums and subsequent filtering based on a range of controllable parameters. Moreover, the 'Biopeak' package provides a series of data exploration tools including: expression profile plots, correlation heat maps and clustering functionalities.
